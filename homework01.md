Q.1)Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty. <br>
Ans:<br>
    Brooks  mentioned that there is no Silver Bullet in Software Engineering. That means that there is no single development in software technology like in the field of Hardware, that by itself promises tenfold improvement within a decade.
     Brooks considered the difficulties that we encounter while developing a software product as being divided into two types of categories:<br>
 1. Essential difficulties  <br>
 2. Accidental difficulties <br>
  
 Essential difficulties as defined by Brooks are the ones that are inherent in the nature of the software. This involves the data sets,algorithms,functions and relationship among the data entities. These may be the same in many differnet representations, but each of them is highly detailed and precise. 
 
 With a lot of debugging and code refactoring, we can eliminate accidental difficulties(not entirely to zero) but the essential difficulties will always remain in the software. Due to this building a software is always going to be hard and hence comes the notion of No silver bullet being present in the field of software technology.
